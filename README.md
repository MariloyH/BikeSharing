# BikeSharing
BootCamp Week14. CityBike with Tableau
# Overview
This project was intended to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal through a bike trip analysis, taking bikeshare data from CitiBike in New York City. Althought Des Moines is not a large and dinamic city as New York City, its data can help us answer a few questions:  
  - Who uses bikeshare program?
  - How often they them?
  - What days are bikeshare used the most? and the least?
  - Who uses bikeshare the most, men or women? 
  - How old are most frequently users?
  - Who use more the bikes, suscriibers or tourists?
  
To answer this questions, I analized the data with Tableau, taking advantage of its ploting options, combining the resukts and presented as a Tableau Story. 



Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.
Finally, youâ€™ll add these new visualizations to the two you created in this module for your final presentation and analysis to pitch to investors.

Results
While the demographics of Des Moines may be different from the make up of the citizenry of NYC, a cursory look at the makeup of CitiBike riders may shine light on who bikeshare might appeal to, regardless of locale.

In the above image we can see that more than 3/4 of the users are Subscribers, who make regular use of the bikes and are a predictable source of income for the program. Bikeshare program users are also predominantly male, at approximately 5/8 to only about 1/4 female. The remaining 1/8 gender is unknown or undeclared.

n conclusion, bikeshare services are remarkably popular in busy metropolitan areas, where occupied real estate is densely packed and parking spaces may be scarce. The user base is made up mostly of male subscribers, providing regular income to the program. More outreach should be done to attract female riders, but male users seem a reliable market. And main usage seems focused around morning and evening commute times.

If I were to pursue additional lines of inquiry for analysis and visualization, given the data provided, I would explore:

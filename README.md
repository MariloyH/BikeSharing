# BikeSharing
BootCamp Week14. CityBike with Tableau
# Overview
Bike riding is growing as the preferred transportation method for people of all ages. It´s fun, healthy, cheap and lets people see their neighborhood in a new way. Bike-sharing services, like Citi Bike in NYC, lets people to use a bike in a single way to go  to school or work or even in a tourist ride, deliver it in a station, and use another when required. That´s why bike-sharing program could be an atractive and very profitable bussines. Here, we will present the NYC Citi Bike Data Analysis from August 2019 in order to  convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal.

Althought Des Moines is not a large and dinamic city as New York City, its data can help us answer a few questions:  

  - Who uses bikeshare program?
  - How often they them?
  - What days are bikeshare used the most? and the least?
  - Who uses bikeshare the most, men or women? 
  - How old are most frequently users?
  - Who use more the bikes, suscribers or tourists?
 
To answer this questions, I analized the data with Tableau, taking advantage of its ploting options, combining the results and presented it  as a Tableau Story.

## Checkout times for users.
In this plot we can see that mostly users take less than 30 minutes, so we can think they bikes for short trips, maybe to work, to school or only fot shor trips instead using motor driven transportation.

# Results
Taking the experience of NYC with bikesharing service, may be very productive to give us a light about how atractive could be this service in Des Moines, Iowa. Althought there are very different cities in population, demographics, even weather, the fact is tha biking had became very popular among people of all ages. Its a healthy, non contaminant, cheap and fun way of transportation,so it´s not a far-fetched idea that a bikesharing service like Citi Bike becomes successful in a metroplolitan area as  Des Moines.
I order to take a bvetter decisition, I would propose two aditional plots.
  1. users per age, para istiguir nuestro potencial mercado de clientes 
  2. bicletas por usuarios, para calcular cuantas bicicletas necesitariamos  al principio.

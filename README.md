# BikeSharing
BootCamp Week14. CityBike with Tableau
# Overview
This project was intended to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal through a bike trip analysis.

Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.
Finally, youâ€™ll add these new visualizations to the two you created in this module for your final presentation and analysis to pitch to investors.
